## ACPI POST error fix

I added this as without it, I would get a POST error every time I booted the machine.
This is a problem universal to HP systems, the solution is just as universal, this patch should work for 99% of HP laptops that experience this issue:

```
Comment | String  | RTC fix to stop POST error
Enabled | Boolean | Yes
Count   | Number  | 0
Limit   | Number  | 0
Find    | Data    | 47017000 70000108
Replace | Data    | 47017000 70000102
```
In the ACPI - Patch section.
